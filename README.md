## Implementation details
This software tries to replicate the accelerometer-only (without full IMU) arm-elevation finding algorithm used in the article ["An iPhone application for upper arm posture and movement measurements"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2017.02.012) by Liyun Yang et al. in MATLAB for used with Axivity AX3 accelerometers. Consider this as a draft first implementation and use this tool (if you must ðŸ˜€) with abundance of caution. Furthermore, it should be pointed out simple arm-elevation finding (which uses just inclination with respect to gravity) with a single zero-reference-position correction, may not be adequate and dual-angle reference position correction (both zero and 90 degrees) is perhaps preferable. See: [Is what you see what you get? Standard inclinometry of set upper arm elevation angles](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2014.08.014) by Jennie Jackson et al.
